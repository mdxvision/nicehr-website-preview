## Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Precision over persuasion
We do not convince.
We state.

If a sentence tries to persuade, it must be rewritten.

### 2. Verbs over adjectives
Describe what happens, not how impressive it is.

Preferred verbs:
Built, Delivered, Designed, Aligned, Supported, Measured, Implemented

Avoid adjectives such as:
Strategic, Innovative, Best-in-class, World-class, Transformative

### 3. One idea per sentence
If a sentence contains multiple clauses, it is suspect.

Short sentences are preferred.
Sentence fragments are acceptable if declarative.

### 4. Outcome framing only
Describe results first.
Capabilities support the outcome.

Correct:
Revenue cycle workflows designed to improve accuracy and visibility.

Incorrect:
We offer revenue cycle management services.

### 5. Calm authority
Tone should feel:
Composed, Inevitable, Senior

Never:
Clever, Emotional, Enthusiastic
