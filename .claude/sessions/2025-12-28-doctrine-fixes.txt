⏺ Here's a summary of the documentation:

  ---
  README.md

  Establishes that the project follows the Enterprise Apple for Healthcare Consulting doctrine. All content must conform to this standard. If conflicts arise, ENTERPRISE_APPLE_DOCTRINE.md takes priority.

  ---
  ENTERPRISE_APPLE_DOCTRINE.md

  The core language doctrine defining how NICEHR communicates:

  What "Enterprise Apple" means:
  - How Apple communicates with healthcare systems, governments, and regulated enterprises
  - Aligns with Deloitte/Atos communication standards

  Core Principles:
  1. Precision over persuasion - State, don't convince
  2. Verbs over adjectives - Built, Delivered, Designed (not "innovative" or "strategic")
  3. One idea per sentence - Short, declarative
  4. Outcome framing - Results first, capabilities second
  5. Calm authority - Composed, inevitable, senior (never clever or enthusiastic)

  Formatting:
  - Headlines: 4–6 words, periods encouraged, no slogans
  - Section intros: One sentence only
  - Body: One sentence per thought, concrete language

  ---
  AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md

  Specific rules for AI-generated content:

  Prohibited words: Strategic, Best-in-class, Cutting-edge, Revolutionary, World-class, Leading, Innovative, Transformative, Next-gen, Disruptive

  Approved CTAs: Explore Solutions, Talk to an Expert, Schedule a Consultation, Request Proposal, View Case Studies, etc.

  Avoid: "Let's talk", "Get started", "Learn more", "Discover", persuasive questions ("Ready to…?"), emotional framing

  Client logos section: Header must be "Healthcare organizations served."

  Claims: Numbers must be sourced; avoid unsupported % claims

  ---
  Final test for all content: Would this be appropriate in an RFP? Would a hospital CIO trust it?

  Guideline Compliance Audit Report

  HIGH PRIORITY - Direct Violations

  1. Taglines/Slogans (Prohibited)

  The doctrine explicitly states: "No slogans or taglines"

  | File                | Line | Violation                                    |
  |---------------------|------|----------------------------------------------|
  | index.html          | 9    | Title: "Healthcare IT. Simplified."          |
  | index.html          | 91   | Hero: "Healthcare IT Consulting. Delivered." |
  | physicians-rcm.html | 89   | "Practice Growth. Simplified."               |

  2. Prohibited CTA "Learn more"

  | File         | Line | Violation                                      |
  |--------------|------|------------------------------------------------|
  | contact.html | 164  | "Learn more about our services and solutions." |

  3. Prohibited Phrase "We offer"

  | File     | Line | Violation                                 |
  |----------|------|-------------------------------------------|
  | faq.html | 144  | "We offer flexible engagement options..." |

  ---
  MEDIUM PRIORITY - Tone Violations

  4. Promotional Language/Superlatives

  | File               | Line | Issue                                           |
  |--------------------|------|-------------------------------------------------|
  | ehr-systems.html   | 100  | "The most widely adopted EHR" - superlative     |
  | ehr-systems.html   | 165  | "modern practices" - promotional                |
  | rcm-platform.html  | 106  | "seamless integration" - promotional            |
  | hospitals-rcm.html | 148  | "Seamless EHR Extension" - promotional headline |

  5. "Comprehensive" (superlative-adjacent)

  | File            | Line | Context                         |
  |-----------------|------|---------------------------------|
  | rcm.html        | 121  | "Comprehensive Solutions"       |
  | faq.html        | 191  | "comprehensive EHR training"    |
  | veterans.html   | 120  | "Comprehensive online training" |
  | government.html | 278  | "Comprehensive IT support"      |

  ---
  LOW PRIORITY - Minor Issues

  6. "Strategic" in Navigation

  The word "strategic" (prohibited) appears as "IT Strategic Planning" in navigation across all 23 HTML pages. This is a service name, so it may be acceptable—but consider renaming to "IT Planning" for full compliance.

  ---
  COMPLIANT ITEMS (Good Adherence)

  - Client logos header: Correctly uses "Healthcare organizations served."
  - CTAs: Most are compliant (Explore Solutions, Talk to an Expert, Contact, Request Proposal, View Platform, View RCM, etc.)
  - Stats scoping: Numbers properly qualified with "(as of 2025)"
  - Delivery network language: Correctly uses "Delivered through NICEHR's delivery network"
  - Testimonials: Direct quotes from clients are acceptable even with promotional language

  ---
  Summary

  | Priority | Count               |
  |----------|---------------------|
  | High     | 5 violations        |
  | Medium   | 8 violations        |
  | Low      | 1 (across 23 files) |

  Overall: The site follows most guidelines well. Main issues are taglines in titles/headers and scattered promotional adjectives. Would you like me to fix these violations?

  Note: The "IT Strategic Planning" service name in navigation remains unchanged since it's a specific service title. If you'd like to rename it to "IT Planning" across all 23 pages, let me know.

> is there a way we can create some memory here so when we come back to a 
session we start from where we left off 

⏺ claude-code-guide(Find Claude Code memory features)
  ⎿  Done (4 tool uses · 25.3k tokens · 32s)                               

⏺ Yes, there are several ways to persist context across sessions:

  1. Project Memory (CLAUDE.md)

  Create a CLAUDE.md file in your project root that automatically loads each session:

⏺ Write(CLAUDE.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 39 lines to CLAUDE.md                                           
     # The NICEHR Group Website
     ## Writing Doctrine
     This project follows the **Enterprise Apple for Healthcare 
     Consulting** doctrine.
     See `ENTERPRISE_APPLE_DOCTRINE.md` and `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for full
     guidelines.
     **Key rules:**
     - No slogans or taglines
     - No promotional language (strategic, innovative, comprehensive,
     seamless, etc.)
     - Short, declarative sentences
     … +29 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Created CLAUDE.md - this file automatically loads every time you start Claude Code in this directory.

  2. Resume Sessions

  You can also resume previous conversations directly:

  # Continue your most recent session
  claude --continue

  # Pick from a list of past sessions
  claude --resume

  3. Name Sessions for Easy Resumption

  During a session, name it for later:
  /rename nicehr-doctrine-fixes

  Then resume by name:
  claude --resume nicehr-doctrine-fixes

  4. View Current Memory

  Check what's loaded:
  /memory

  ---
  What I set up for you:

  The CLAUDE.md now contains:
  - Writing doctrine summary
  - Approved/prohibited language
  - Site structure
  - Key pages reference
  - Recent work history

  Next time you run claude in this folder, it will automatically know the project context and doctrine rules.

  Regarding conversation export - yes, you can export the current session:

⏺ claude-code-guide(Find conversation export options)
  ⎿  Done (6 tool uses · 24.4k tokens · 16s)                               

⏺ Yes, you can export conversations:

  Would you like me to create a docs/ or .claude/sessions/ folder to store exported conversations? You could run /export .claude/sessions/2025-12-28-doctrine-fixes.md to save this session there.
